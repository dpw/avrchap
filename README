# A tool for programming ATmega microcontrollers using a Raspberry Pi

avrchap writes to the Flash program memory of an Atmal ATmega
microcontroller from a Raspberry Pi.  In can be used to write a
bootloader to an ATmega (e.g. the optiboot bootloader used by
Arduino).  It's based on the datasheet that covers the ATmega48A,
48PA, 88A, 88PA, 168A, 168PA, 328, 328P, so should work with that
range, but was developed and tested with the 328PU.

It uses the "Serial Downloading" programming mode of the ATmega.  This
is based on
[SPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus),
so it's a natural fit for the SPI bus available on the Raspberry Pi's
GPIO header.

After I wrote this, I found that there is [a fork of avrdude that does
the same
thing](http://kevincuzner.com/2013/05/27/raspberry-pi-as-an-avr-programmer/).
You might want to use that instead.  But avrchap is easier to build
because it doesn't have any dependencies, and it is an example of how
to use the Raspberry Pi's SPI bus from C, so here it is.

## Connecting the Raspberry Pi to an ATmega for programming

WARNING: I'm new to this stuff. It worked for me, but it's easy to
make mistakes that could fry your Raspberry Pi or ATmega or both. You
might want to double-check my working here.

With that said, it's pretty simple.  ATmega pin numbers assume the 28
PDIP package.

| RPi GPIO header pin | ATmega pin |
|---------------------|------------|
| 17 (3V3)            | 7 (VCC)    |
| 17 (3V3)            | 20 (AVCC)  |
| 19 (SPI_MOSI)       | 17 (MOSI)  |
| 21 (SPI_MISO)       | 18 (MISO)  |
| 23 (SPI_SCLK)       | 19 (SCLK)  |
| 24 (SPI_CE0_N)      | 1 (RESET#) |
| 25 (GND)            | 8 (GND)    |

The factory setting for ATmega fuses selects the internal oscillator,
so it shouldn't be necessary to connect an external oscillator unless
you changed the fuses settings already.

## Usage

To build, simply do:

    $ make

As root, use the `-p` option to write a HEX file to the program memory:

    $ sudo ./avrchap -p optiboot_atmega328.hex

And the `-F`, `-H`, `-E` and `-L` options to set the fuse bits, the
high fuse bits, the extended fuse bits, and the lock bits,
respectively:

    $ sudo ./avrchap -F 0xff -H 0xde -E 0x05 -L 0x0f
